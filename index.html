                <h1 class="section-title"> What is Garbh-Sanskar?<span></span></h1>
                <p>The word garbh in sanskrit refers to foetus in the womb, and sanskar means education of the mind. So, garbh sanskar translates into the process of educating the mind of unborn baby.</p>

                    <h2>Communication With Baby</h2>
                    <p>Talking to your baby belly can have benefits for the parents, too. It can be bonding time for the whole family, and allow the baby to hear a second parent's voice, too. It is also important for parents that are using a gestational
                        carrier (surrogate) to carry the pregnancy to talk to their bab in the womb.</p>

                    <p>Music can play an important role in your child's growth, even before birth. Exposing your child to music ignites all areas of child development. And doing this early can help ensure that your baby grows up healthy.</p>

                    <h2>Why do we do garbh Sanskar?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Garbh Sanskar helps us to understand well-scheduled pregnancy. Through this education, pregnant woman learns the way to give mentally and physically healthy child. Mother holds the baby in her womb for nine months and it is not the easy journey for her.
                        She needs the care of her husband and her family as well.</p>

                            feel your baby move, which is called "quickening." An ultrasound is usually done for all pregnant women at 20 weeks. During this ultrasound, the doctor will make sure that the placenta is healthy and attached normally and that
                            your baby is growing properly. You can see the baby's heartbeat and movement of its body, arms, and legs on the ultrasound. You can usually find out whether it's a boy or a girl at 20 weeks.

                        <p>The baby weighs almost 4 pounds and is moving around often. The baby's skin has fewer wrinkles as a layer of fat starts to form under the skin. Between now and delivery, your baby will gain up to half their birth weight. Ask your
                            doctor how to do a fetal movement chart. Think about breastfeeding. You may notice a yellowish fluid leaking from your breasts. That is colostrum, and it happens to get your breasts ready for making milk. Most women go to the

                        <p>Babies differ in size, depending on many factors, such as gender, the number of babies being carried, and size of the parents. So your baby's overall rate of growth is as important as the actual size. On average, a baby at this
                            stage is about 18.5 inches and weighs close to 6 pounds. The brain has been developing rapidly. Lungs are nearly fully developed. The head is usually positioned down into the pelvis by now. Your baby is considered at 'term'
                            when they are 37 weeks. They are an early term baby if born between 37-39 weeks, at term, if they're 39-40 weeks and late term if they're 41-42 weeks.</p>

                        <p>A mother's due date marks the end of their 40th week. The delivery date is calculated using the first day of their last period. Based on this, pregnancy can last between 38 and 42 weeks with a full-term delivery happening around
                            40 weeks. Some post-term pregnancies -- those lasting more than 42 weeks -- are not really late. The due date may just not be accurate. For safety reasons, most babies are delivered by 42 weeks. Sometimes the doctor may need
                            to induce labor.
